# Midterm Projects

The midterm projects are a significant component of the course, giving students the opportunity to apply their knowledge to formalize and verify mathematical or computational concepts in Lean. 
These projects will build problem-solving skills, encourage creativity, and allow students to explore the potential of interactive theorem proving. 
The midterm project will be evaluated based on technical accuracy, clarity of exposition, creativity, and teamwork.
