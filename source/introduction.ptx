      For the midterm project, you will work in a small group to formalize and prove a result in Lean.
      Below are two project options.
      Each project will require you to formalize precise definitions and prove supporting lemmas to complete a central proof.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your project will be graded on correctness, clarity, Lean style, and collaboration.
      Choose one option and submit your choice by April 4.
